# Matrix Message github action

This is a simple github action to send files to matrix servers along with a message

## Usage

Sending messages requires generating of an access token, which can be done with
`curl`, and is detailed [here](https://matrix.org/docs/guides/client-server-api/).

The Room ID does not refer to the room's name, but its unique ID. In Element, this
can be found by navigating to 'Room Settings' -> 'Advanced'.


```workflow
name: Send a hello world to matrix every 5 minutes
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    
jobs:
  matrix-file-upload:
   runs-on: ubuntu-latest
   steps:
      - name: Send to Matrix
        uses: daedric7/Matrix-Send-File@v0.2-beta6
        with:
          room_id: ${{ secrets.MATRIX_ROOM_ID }}
          access_token: ${{ secrets.MATRIX_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
          server: "https://how-to-reach-your-server.com"
          file: file/to/send.zip
          message: "Message to send"
          filename: "FinalFilename.zip" #Optional    
```


## Credits

This project was primarily created by Martin Pugh (pugh@s3kr.it). This version is a very slight change that might be
contributed back soon.

I just changed the one from olabiniV2/Matrix-Message further.

Alsom creddit to fabianonline/matrix.sh from where i took matrix.sh and tampered with.
